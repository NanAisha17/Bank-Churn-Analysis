#  Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a bank and presenting insights through an interactive dashboard. The analysis helps identify key drivers of churn, such as demographics, geography, tenure, satisfaction, and financial behavior.

The dashboard was replicated as part of a guided hands-on internship training project to strengthen skills in Excel while showcasing the importance of data-driven decision-making.

##  Objectives

* Understand churn patterns across different customer groups.
* Identify high-risk segments for churn (e.g., by age, gender, geography).
* Explore the impact of credit score, complaints, satisfaction, and bank balance on churn.
* Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

##  Key Insights

* Geography: Germany has the highest churn rate (32.44%) compared to Spain and France.
* Gender: Female customers churn more (25.07%) than males (18.47%).
* Age: Churn is positively correlated with age (correlation coefficient: 0.50).
* Tenure: Longer-tenure customers show slightly lower churn rates, but loyalty benefits may be needed after 7+ years.
* Credit Score: Lower credit scores are associated with higher churn (correlation: -0.44).
* Complaints: Customers who complain are extremely likely to churn (100%).
* Balance: Customers with higher balances are more likely to churn.

##ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended to reduce churn:

1. Germany-focused Retention Programs: Develop localized strategies for Germany since it shows the highest churn rate.
2. Target Female Customers: Introduce engagement and loyalty campaigns tailored to female customers who churn at higher rates.
3. Credit Score Support: Provide financial advisory or credit improvement programs for customers with low credit scores to strengthen trust.
4. Complaint Resolution: Build a stronger feedback and issue-resolution system since complaints strongly predict churn.
5. High-Balance Customers: Offer personalized relationship management or exclusive benefits for high-balance customers who are at greater churn risk.
6. Loyalty Beyond 7 Years: Enhance reward programs for customers with tenure above 7 years to sustain engagement and reduce long-term churn.
7. Customer Satisfaction Programs: Focus improvements on middle satisfaction score groups (2â€“4), where small gains could significantly reduce churn.
